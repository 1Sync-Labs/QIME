## Syncing Customers

One of the objects that is essential to be linked is the `Customer` object in QuickBooks. All accounting entities within QuickBooks are linked to customers. This means that accounts in Salesforce need to be linked to customers in QuickBooks. Most implementations will need to account for creating new customers, and syncing existing customers to accounts.

### Creating New Customers from Accounts

If you are starting with a fresh account, and the customer does not exist inside of QuickBooks, this is the easiest path to push data. There is an action to create new customers in QB from Salesforce accounts. To add this to the page layout:

1. Go to `Setup` â†’ `Object Manager`
2. Navigate to `Account`
3. Select `Page Layouts` and open the desired page layout
4. In the `Mobile & Lightning Actions` find the `Sync w/ QB` action and add this to the actions section.

From here, just press `Sync w/ QB` on any account that needs to be pushed to QuickBooks.

### Syncing Existing Accounts and Customers

Syncing existing customers within 2 data sets can be a challenging and laborious effort. While it would be nice to be able to link this data automatically, there are too many edge cases to make this possible. If you are looking to sync the two databases, the general workflow is as follows:

1. Export data from both systems.
2. Use `VLOOKUP` in an Excel sheet to match the databases on fields like name and email.
3. Update the `qime__QB_Id__c` field in Salesforce using the newly merged data.
